               <h3>Stanley</h3>
               <p class = "funwritting">Stanley is a mix. I can't remember of what. He's a very smart dog, but doesn't really like people. We only had Stanley for about a year or two. Stanley and Jenny didn't get along, but my cousin (from ATLANTA ) loved Stanley, so she and her wife decided to adopt him in. He's been very happy with them and I get to visit anytime I want. He's become very strong and knows so many tricks! I love seeing how big he's gotten.</p>
